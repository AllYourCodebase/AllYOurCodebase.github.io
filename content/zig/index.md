## Is Zig complete?
No, Zig is still in heavy development. 
If you want to help us move forward faster, 
[consider donating](https://ziglang.org/zsf/) 
so that we can pay more contributors for their time.

## Is Zig made by a big tech company?
No, Zig is supported by the Zig Software Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit 
company. We will never concede board seats to any big tech company.

## Is Zig production-ready?
The Zig compiler toolchain is being used to cross-compile C/C++/ObjC
[by Uber](https://jakstys.lt/2022/how-uber-uses-zig/) and a few other 
companies.

The Zig programming language is not being used in production by any big
company and it's currently not recommended to use Zig for mission-critical
software as the language is still under development and there are 
[known bugs](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug)
and even some 
[miscompilations](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Amiscompilation).

Some companies are preparing to be early adopters for when Zig becomes more 
suitable for production use. One example is [Coil](https://coil.com), which is
working on [TigerBeetle](https://tigerbeetle.com).

We know of [some cases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=124wdTckHNY) where Zig 
is being used in production despite its immaturity.
